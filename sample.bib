	abstract  = {Genetic programming (GP) is a systematic, domain-independent method for getting computers to solve problems automatically starting from a high-level statement of what needs to be done. Using ideas from natural evolution, GP starts from an ooze of random computer programs, and progressively refines them through processes of mutation and sexual recombination, until high-fitness solutions emerge. All this without the user having to know or specify the form or structure of solutions in advance. GP has generated a plethora of human-competitive results and applications, including novel scientific discoveries and patentable inventions.}

        abstract = {This thesis explores the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to automatically generate understandable agent controllers for the game Bomberman using guarded command programs (GCPs). This approach evolves agents represented by a fixed-size set of human-readable, condition-action rules within the Pommerman environment. Experiments analyzing various mutation and crossover strategies confirmed that the GCP structure is effective at producing interpretable agent logic. The results demonstrate that the GA successfully evolved agents capable of basic survival tactics, primarily by learning to avoid self-destructive behaviors. However, the key finding of this research is that agent performance was fundamentally constrained by the fitness function, which failed to adequately reward complex strategic and tactical maneuvers. This work concludes that while GAs combined with GCPs provide a viable framework for generating understandable AI, achieving high-level strategic competence is critically dependent on the design of a more sophisticated fitness function that can guide evolution beyond simple behaviors.},
